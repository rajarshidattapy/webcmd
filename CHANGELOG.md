# Changelog

## [0.2.3](https://github.com/agentrhq/webcmd/compare/webcmd-v0.2.2...webcmd-v0.2.3) (2026-07-09)

### Highlights
- Added four new e-commerce and booking adapters: Blinkit, Zepto, BigBasket, and Practo, enabling automated workflows for groceries, deliveries, and appointments.
- Hardened the District adapter's checkout command to prevent incorrect seat selection, ensuring payment flows are initiated with the exact items requested.

### Improvements
- Introduced a new plugin catalog to support community-developed commands, starting with the `skyscanner` plugin for flight searches.
- The adapter-author skill now provides a more interactive scaffolding experience by asking for user use cases before recommending and generating subsequent commands.
- Improved the release automation workflow to auto-generate more detailed release notes and update the `CHANGELOG.md` file.

### Fixes
None.

### Adapters
- **BigBasket**: Added the `bigbasket` adapter for online grocery shopping, with commands for `search`, `product`, `category`, `add-to-cart`, `cart`, and a review-only `checkout`.
- **Blinkit**: Added a new `blinkit` adapter for grocery delivery, with commands for the full buying path: `login`, `search`, `product`, `add-to-cart`, `cart`, `checkout`, and `place-order`.
- **District**: Hardened the `district checkout` command by adding two new guards. It now reconciles the selected seats with the requested seats to prevent auto-selection of extra tickets, and adds a final assertion on the review page to ensure order accuracy before payment.
- **Practo**: Added a comprehensive `practo` adapter for healthcare appointments. It supports doctor discovery (`search`, `profile`), slot booking (`slots`, `book-preview`, `book-confirm`), and appointment management (`appointments`, `appointment`, `cancel`).
- **Zepto**: Introduced the `zepto` adapter for quick commerce, including commands for `login`, `location`, `search`, `product`, `add-to-cart`, `cart`, `checkout`, and `place-order`.

## [0.2.2](https://github.com/agentrhq/webcmd/compare/webcmd-v0.2.1...webcmd-v0.2.2) (2026-07-09)

### Highlights

- Bundled Webcmd skills are now much easier to install and refresh through `webcmd skills install` and `webcmd skills update`.
- Persistent-session commands gained a cleaner authoring model with `freshPage`, which keeps login/profile state while avoiding stale page state.
- District booking support moved from local-only adapters into the repo.

### Improvements

- Added `freshPage: true` for persistent site-session commands so adapter authors can start from a clean tab without throwing away cookies or profile state.
- Added bundled Webcmd skill installation and update flows for supported agents.
- Repaired the plugin-management e2e test by replacing a deleted test plugin repository with a live plugin repository.
- Refreshed README guidance around the current project positioning.

### Fixes

- Preserved `freshPage` in generated CLI manifests.
- Fixed District output validation so adapter columns such as `number`, `row`, `seat`, and `_score` are not silently dropped.
- Quoted sitemap author skill frontmatter for strict YAML parsers.
- Fixed Reddit popular HTML response handling.

### Adapters

- Promoted the District (`district.in`) movie and event booking adapters into `clis/district`.
- Added and hardened District flows for search, listings, showtimes, seats, checkout, locations, location switching, and auth status checks.
- Hardened District checkout with clean-start sessions, a login gate before seat selection, stale-session refresh, and payment-handoff behavior.
- Added the shared site-auth `openLogin(page)` hook for modal-based login flows such as District.
