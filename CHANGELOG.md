* traverse ignored AX intermediaries ([91a1ff8](https://github.com/agentrhq/webcmd/commit/91a1ff8ef699cdc6947db8f469f857b54b17e412))

## [0.3.3](https://github.com/agentrhq/webcmd/compare/webcmd-v0.3.2...webcmd-v0.3.3) (2026-07-16)

### Highlights
*   Skill management has been improved with new and renamed commands. Use `webcmd skills add` (formerly `install`) to add bundled skills to your agent environment, and the new `webcmd skills remove` to safely remove them.

### Improvements
*   Browser sessions are now more robust. `webcmd` can recover sessions after an unexpected closure and will prevent multiple commands from writing to the same persistent session at the same time. Blocked commands will now exit with a status code of 75 to signal that the session is busy.
*   Commands can now be authored with `freshPage: true` metadata, allowing them to run in a new, clean browser tab while preserving an existing login session.
*   The project's `README.md` now includes prominent links to the full documentation site at [webcmd.dev/docs](https://webcmd.dev/docs).
*   Corrected the adapter authoring documentation for `webcmd browser init` to remove a non-existent `--strategy` flag.

### Fixes
*   The `webcmd doctor` command now correctly reports the installed version of the Cloak browser runtime instead of "version unknown".
*   Local-only commands, such as `webcmd skills`, now run correctly when `webcmd` is configured for hosted (cloud) mode.

### Adapters
*   The `producthunt` adapter now correctly detects and reports security verification pages, preventing commands from failing unexpectedly.

## [0.3.1](https://github.com/agentrhq/webcmd/compare/webcmd-v0.3.0...webcmd-v0.3.1) (2026-07-15)

### Improvements
* The `webcmd plugin create` command now prompts for an author name and GitHub handle to include in the new plugin's metadata.
* The `webcmd-autofix` skill for AI agents has been updated with a workflow to report unresolved, reproducible `webcmd` failures to the development team.

### Fixes
* On macOS, running a browser-based command with `--window background` will no longer bring the browser to the foreground on its first launch.

### Adapters
* **LinkedIn**: Two new adapters have been added:
    * `linkedin company`: Reads a company's profile page for details like industry, size, headquarters, and follower count.
    * `linkedin connections`: Lists your first-degree connections with their names, headlines, and profile URLs.
* **ChatGPT**:
    * `chatgpt deep-research-result`: This command can now report the progress of an ongoing Deep Research task, not just the final completed report.
    * `chatgpt ask`: Improved reliability when waiting for a response to finish generating.
* **Facebook**:
    * `facebook search`: The reliability of the search workflow has been improved.

## [0.3.0](https://github.com/agentrhq/webcmd/compare/webcmd-v0.2.5...webcmd-v0.3.0) (2026-07-13)

### Highlights
- Introduces a new hosted execution mode, allowing `webcmd` to operate as a thin client against the Webcmd Cloud API. This offloads command execution and browser automation to the cloud service and can be configured with a new `setup` command.

### Improvements
- Agent skill documentation has been updated to improve command discovery and error handling:
  - Adds a fallback to search for installable plugins (`webcmd plugin search`) when a command is not found locally.
  - Clarifies that running `webcmd` with no arguments lists all available commands.
  - Provides better guidance on handling network errors during `webcmd plugin search`, prompting users to retry if a fetch fails.

### Fixes
- The `--window background` flag now correctly prevents browser-backed commands from stealing focus.

### Adapters
- Authentication commands (like `whoami` and `login`) that use the shared site-auth helper now correctly wrap their JSON output in an array, making them compatible with agent workflows expecting structured rows.
- The `antigravity` adapter no longer incorrectly registers itself as an installable agent skill.

## [0.2.5](https://github.com/agentrhq/webcmd/compare/webcmd-v0.2.4...webcmd-v0.2.5) (2026-07-10)

### Improvements
- Added new commands for plugin discovery and management. Use `webcmd plugin search` to find new community plugins, and `webcmd plugin catalog` subcommands to manage the marketplace sources where `webcmd` searches.
- Documentation has been updated to explain the new plugin monorepo model, where community adapters can be promoted directly into the main repository. This makes them easier to discover and install.

### Adapters
- The BikeWale adapter has been promoted to the main repository as a community plugin.

## [0.2.4](https://github.com/agentrhq/webcmd/compare/webcmd-v0.2.3...webcmd-v0.2.4) (2026-07-10)

### Highlights
- Introduced a plugin marketplace for discovering and installing new adapters. Use the new `webcmd plugin search` command to find available plugins and `webcmd plugin catalog` to manage marketplace sources.

### Fixes
- Fixed failures to launch a browser session when the profile was locked or left in a stale state from a previous run.

### Adapters
- Hardened the `practo login` command to wait for manual sign-in to complete, and added a `--timeout` option.

## [0.2.3](https://github.com/agentrhq/webcmd/compare/webcmd-v0.2.2...webcmd-v0.2.3) (2026-07-09)

### Highlights
- Added four new e-commerce and booking adapters: Blinkit, Zepto, BigBasket, and Practo, enabling automated workflows for groceries, deliveries, and appointments.
- Hardened the District adapter's checkout command to prevent incorrect seat selection, ensuring payment flows are initiated with the exact items requested.

### Improvements
- Introduced a new plugin catalog to support community-developed commands, starting with the `skyscanner` plugin for flight searches.
- The adapter-author skill now provides a more interactive scaffolding experience by asking for user use cases before recommending and generating subsequent commands.
- Improved the release automation workflow to auto-generate more detailed release notes and update the `CHANGELOG.md` file.

### Fixes
None.

### Adapters
- **BigBasket**: Added the `bigbasket` adapter for online grocery shopping, with commands for `search`, `product`, `category`, `add-to-cart`, `cart`, and a review-only `checkout`.
- **Blinkit**: Added a new `blinkit` adapter for grocery delivery, with commands for the full buying path: `login`, `search`, `product`, `add-to-cart`, `cart`, `checkout`, and `place-order`.
- **District**: Hardened the `district checkout` command by adding two new guards. It now reconciles the selected seats with the requested seats to prevent auto-selection of extra tickets, and adds a final assertion on the review page to ensure order accuracy before payment.
- **Practo**: Added a comprehensive `practo` adapter for healthcare appointments. It supports doctor discovery (`search`, `profile`), slot booking (`slots`, `book-preview`, `book-confirm`), and appointment management (`appointments`, `appointment`, `cancel`).
- **Zepto**: Introduced the `zepto` adapter for quick commerce, including commands for `login`, `location`, `search`, `product`, `add-to-cart`, `cart`, `checkout`, and `place-order`.

## [0.2.2](https://github.com/agentrhq/webcmd/compare/webcmd-v0.2.1...webcmd-v0.2.2) (2026-07-09)

### Highlights

- Bundled Webcmd skills are now much easier to add and refresh through `webcmd skills add` and `webcmd skills update`.
- Persistent-session commands gained a cleaner authoring model with `freshPage`, which keeps login/profile state while avoiding stale page state.
- District booking support moved from local-only adapters into the repo.

### Improvements

- Added `freshPage: true` for persistent site-session commands so adapter authors can start from a clean tab without throwing away cookies or profile state.
- Added bundled Webcmd skill installation and update flows for supported agents.
- Repaired the plugin-management e2e test by replacing a deleted test plugin repository with a live plugin repository.
- Refreshed README guidance around the current project positioning.

### Fixes

- Preserved `freshPage` in generated CLI manifests.
- Fixed District output validation so adapter columns such as `number`, `row`, `seat`, and `_score` are not silently dropped.
- Quoted sitemap author skill frontmatter for strict YAML parsers.
- Fixed Reddit popular HTML response handling.

### Adapters

- Promoted the District (`district.in`) movie and event booking adapters into `clis/district`.
- Added and hardened District flows for search, listings, showtimes, seats, checkout, locations, location switching, and auth status checks.
- Hardened District checkout with clean-start sessions, a login gate before seat selection, stale-session refresh, and payment-handoff behavior.
- Added the shared site-auth `openLogin(page)` hook for modal-based login flows such as District.
