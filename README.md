# Webcmd

**Self-learning browser infra for AI agents.**

WebCMD learns the navigational context of websites as agents use them, then compiles that knowledge into deterministic commands for faster, cheaper, more reliable browser automation. The goal is simple: stop making agents rediscover the same sites on every run and cut browser-agent token spend by up to 90%.

On top of live browser control, WebCMD adds 3 layers of learnings. Each layer collapses cost and variance for the layer above it.

| Layer | Scenario | What Webcmd Helps With |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Live browser control | The site is unfamiliar. | Use `webcmd browser` to inspect, click, type, extract, capture network calls, and complete the task in a real browser. |
| 2. Sitemap memory | The site is familiar, but the action space is not fully known. | Capture an agent-facing sitemap of observed pages, states, actions, workflows, APIs, pitfalls, and fallback paths. |
| 3. CLI authoring | The action space is known, but the path is still too variable for one fixed sequence. | Explicitly author a reusable `webcmd <site>` adapter with structured output, so future agents spend tokens on the task instead of navigation. |
| 4. Extend existing CLIs | The workflow is deterministic enough to stop browsing. | Extend the `webcmd <site>` adapter with a tailored command so the workflow runs instantly with the least amount of tokens. |

## Demo

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install -g @agentrhq/webcmd
webcmd skills add
```

In your agent harness, load or tag `webcmd-usage`, then describe the outcome you want.

```text
Use the webcmd-usage skill to find the best way to research the latest discussions about browser automation across Hacker News and Reddit. Reuse existing adapters where possible and return a concise comparison with source links.
```

## What You Can Ask

- “Use `webcmd-usage` to find an existing adapter for this research task and return title, URL, and source.”
- “Complete this unfamiliar-site task, keep it read-only, and return the requested fields with source links.”
- “Create a reusable Webcmd CLI for this supplier portal that returns price, stock, MOQ, lead time, and product URL.”
- “Use my logged-in `work` profile for this dashboard task; pause if I need to sign in and never store credentials.”
- “Repair this broken Webcmd command, preserve its output schema, verify it, and explain the fix.”
- “Create a reusable plugin for these workflows, run its checks, and prepare it for community publishing without merging or publishing it.”

## See It in Action: X → CLI

```text
Use my logged-in `social` profile to collect my recent X bookmarks, then turn the successful workflow into a reusable Webcmd command that returns author, text, and URL. Verify it before finishing.
```

The agent explores the X workflow once using the logged-in profile.
It creates a stable command that returns the requested bookmark fields.
Later agents reuse that command instead of repeating browser exploration; learn the pattern in [X → CLI](/x-session-cli).

## Where Webcmd Works

| Group | Supported surfaces | Representative outcomes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| research and communities | Hacker News, Reddit, PubMed | Compare current discussions, find primary research, and return concise summaries with source links. |
| social and professional | X/Twitter, LinkedIn, TikTok | Collect bookmarks, monitor public posts, or research people and creators with a named profile when needed. |
| AI tools | ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, NotebookLM | Retrieve conversations, research outputs, notebooks, and generated materials from the tools you already use. |
| shopping and bookings | Amazon, Blinkit, Zepto, BigBasket, District, Practo | Compare products, availability, prices, appointments, events, and delivery options. |

This list is illustrative; agents can use `webcmd-usage` to discover the current surface.

Webcmd Cloud can run supported commands and browser sessions on hosted infrastructure. It is in active development and is not yet stable.
