# Webcmd

**Self-learning browser infra for AI agents.**

WebCMD learns the navigational context of websites as agents use them, then compiles that knowledge into deterministic commands for faster, cheaper, more reliable browser automation. The goal is simple: stop making agents rediscover the same sites on every run and cut browser-agent token spend by up to 90%.

On top of live browser control, WebCMD adds 3 layers of learnings. Each layer collapses cost and variance for the layer above it.

| Layer | Scenario | What Webcmd Helps With |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Live browser control | The site is unfamiliar. | Use `webcmd browser` to inspect, click, type, extract, capture network calls, and complete the task in a real browser. |
| 2. Sitemap memory | The site is familiar, but the action space is not fully known. | Capture an agent-facing sitemap of observed pages, states, actions, workflows, APIs, pitfalls, and fallback paths. |
| 3. CLI authoring | The action space is known, but the path is still too variable for one fixed sequence. | Explicitly author a reusable `webcmd <site>` adapter with structured output, so future agents spend tokens on the task instead of navigation. |
| 4. Extend existing CLIs | The workflow is deterministic enough to stop browsing. | Extend the `webcmd <site>` adapter with a tailored command so the workflow runs instantly with the least amount of tokens. |

## Demo

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04eceadc-d398-4303-984d-ae3197bfa664

## Quick Start

Webcmd requires Node.js 20+.

```bash
npm install -g @agentrhq/webcmd
webcmd skills add
```

When prompted, choose a supported harness such as Codex or Claude, or enter a custom skills path.

Then ask your agent naturally—“use webcmd to…” is enough.

```text
Use webcmd to research the latest discussions about browser automation across Hacker News and Reddit, then return a concise comparison with source links.
```

## What You Can Ask

- “Use webcmd to research agentic browser automation on PubMed and return the title, authors, publication date, abstract, and URL for each result.”
- “Use webcmd to find active AI infrastructure companies in the YC company directory and return the company, batch, description, location, profile URL, and source links. Keep it read-only.”
- “Use webcmd to look up parts on Grainger by part number and return price, stock, minimum order quantity, lead time, and product URL.”
- “Use webcmd with my logged-in `work` profile to summarize unread LinkedIn messages from the last seven days and return the sender, subject or opening text, received time, and conversation URL.”
- “Repair `webcmd reddit popular --limit 10` and keep returning the title, subreddit, score, comment count, and URL.”
- “Use webcmd to check Grainger part prices and SAP Ariba purchase-order status, then return a combined summary.”

## See It in Action: X → CLI

```text
Use webcmd with my logged-in `social` profile to collect my recent X bookmarks and return the author, text, and URL.
```

The agent explores the X workflow once using the logged-in profile.
It creates a stable command that returns the requested bookmark fields.
Later agents reuse that command instead of repeating browser exploration; learn the pattern in [X → CLI](https://webcmd.dev/docs/x-session-cli).

## Where Webcmd Works

Beyond website adapters, Webcmd can work through authenticated browser sessions, APIs, desktop apps, and local tools.

| Group | Supported surfaces | Representative outcomes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| research and communities | Hacker News, Reddit, PubMed | Compare current discussions, find primary research, and return concise summaries with source links. |
| social and professional | X/Twitter, LinkedIn, TikTok | Collect bookmarks, monitor public posts, or research people and creators with a named profile when needed. |
| AI tools | ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, NotebookLM | Retrieve conversations, research outputs, notebooks, and generated materials from the tools you already use. |
| shopping and bookings | Amazon, Blinkit, Zepto, BigBasket, District, Practo | Compare products, availability, prices, appointments, events, and delivery options. |

This list is illustrative; ask your agent to use webcmd to discover what is currently available.

Webcmd Cloud can run supported commands and browser sessions on hosted infrastructure. It is in active development and is not yet stable.
