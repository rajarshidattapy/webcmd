This is the top-level map of what `webcmd` can do, how to discover adapters, what flags and output formats are universal, and which specialized skill to load next.

# webcmd-usage

Webcmd turns websites, Electron desktop apps, and external CLIs into a uniform `webcmd <site> <command>` surface that agents can drive without screen scraping. This skill is the orientation layer. Once you know the task, load the specialized skill that fits it.

## The Three Pillars

- **Adapter commands:** `webcmd <site> <command> [...]`. Built-in adapters live in `clis/`; community adapters promoted to the main repo live as plugins under `plugins/`; private iteration adapters live in `~/.webcmd/clis/`. Each command has a strategy such as `PUBLIC`, `COOKIE`, `INTERCEPT`, `UI`, or `LOCAL`.
- **Browser driving:** `webcmd browser *` subcommands (`open`, `state`, `click`, `type`, `select`, `find`, `extract`, `network`) for ad-hoc interaction when no adapter covers the task. See `webcmd-browser`.
- **External CLI passthrough:** `webcmd gh`, `webcmd docker`, `webcmd vercel`, and similar wrappers. Manage them with `webcmd external install <name>` or `webcmd external register <name>`.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g @agentrhq/webcmd
webcmd doctor
```

From source:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:agentrhq/webcmd.git
cd webcmd
npm install
npx tsx src/main.ts <command>
```

`webcmd doctor` reports daemon status, runtime connection, version checks, and live browser connectivity. It is required for `COOKIE`, `INTERCEPT`, `UI`, and `webcmd browser *` work. It is not required for `PUBLIC`, `LOCAL`, `webcmd list`, `validate`, `verify`, plugin commands, or external CLI passthrough.

## Prerequisites By Strategy

| Strategy | Needs |
| --- | --- |
| `PUBLIC` | No browser; pure HTTP. |
| `COOKIE` | Logged into the target site in the webcmd-managed browser profile. |
| `INTERCEPT` | Same as `COOKIE`, plus an automation window to capture a signed request. |
| `UI` | Same as `COOKIE`, plus full DOM interaction. |
| `LOCAL` | No browser; talks to a local or development endpoint. |

Electron desktop app adapters route through CDP against the running app. Make sure the app is open before invoking those commands.

## Discover Commands

Run commands instead of reading static docs:

```bash
webcmd
webcmd list -f json
webcmd <site> --help
webcmd <site> <command> --help
```

Run `webcmd` with no arguments to see all available functions and installed site adapters. Do not hard-code adapter lists: `webcmd list -f json` is the source of truth and emits one entry per command with fields such as `{site, name, aliases, description, strategy, browser, args, columns}`.

Use this fallback order:

1. Run `webcmd list -f json` once.
2. Check that result against the whole requested workflow, not only a named site. If one installed command covers it, use that command and stop discovery.
3. If none covers it, derive a short plugin query from the missing site or capability and run `webcmd plugin search <query> -f json`. Preserve the user's term when practical: `find flights` becomes `flight`.
4. If plugin search returns a match, offer `webcmd plugin install <installSource>`. If it returns no match and no error, raw `webcmd browser` is allowed. If it errors, report plugin discovery as unavailable possibly due to network permissions, and stop immediately.

## Universal Flags

| Flag | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `-f, --format <fmt>` | `table` in TTY by default; `yaml` outside TTY by default; also supports `json`, `plain`, `md`, `csv`. Agents usually want `-f json`. |
| `-v, --verbose` | Debug logs and stack traces on failure; also sets `WEBCMD_VERBOSE=1`. |

Command-specific flags such as `--limit`, `--tab`, and `--filter` are not universal. Read `<site> <command> --help`.

## Output Formats

- `json`: pretty-printed, 2-space indent. Best default for agents.
- `plain`: prints the primary text field for chat-style commands.
- `yaml`: default when output is not a TTY and `-f` is not explicit.
- `table`: color-coded and grouped for humans.
- `md`, `csv`: tabular dumps.

Some commands override the default through `cmd.defaultFormat`; read `--help`.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `WEBCMD_BROWSER_CONNECT_TIMEOUT` | `45` | Seconds to wait for the browser bridge. |
| `WEBCMD_BROWSER_COMMAND_TIMEOUT` | `60` | Per-command timeout. |
| `WEBCMD_CDP_ENDPOINT` | unset | Manual CDP endpoint override. |
| `WEBCMD_CACHE_DIR` | `~/.webcmd/cache` | Network capture and browser-state cache. |
| `WEBCMD_WINDOW` | command-specific | `foreground` or `background` browser window mode. |
| `WEBCMD_VERBOSE` | `false` | Verbose logging, also triggered by `-v`. |

## Self-Repair

When an adapter command fails because a site changed, rerun with:

```bash
webcmd <site> <command> [args...] --trace retain-on-failure
```

The error envelope includes a `trace` block pointing at `summary.md`. Patch only `adapterSourcePath` from that summary and retry. Maximum 3 repair rounds. See `webcmd-autofix`.

## Writing An Adapter

Storage paths:

- Private: `~/.webcmd/clis/<site>/<command>.js`
- Public (official bundle): `clis/<site>/<command>.js`
- Public (community PRs): `plugins/<site>/` plus root `webcmd-plugin.json` registration

The main Webcmd repo is itself a plugin monorepo: promoted community CLIs belong under `plugins/<site>/` and must be registered in the root `webcmd-plugin.json`.

Scaffolding and checks:

```bash
webcmd browser init <site>/<command>
webcmd validate [target]
webcmd verify [target] [--smoke]
webcmd browser verify <site>/<command>
```

Adapters import only `@agentrhq/webcmd/registry` and `@agentrhq/webcmd/errors`. `columns` must align one-to-one, in name and order, with returned row object keys. See `webcmd-adapter-author`.

## Plugins

```bash
webcmd plugin install github:user/repo
webcmd plugin list [-f json]
webcmd plugin update [name] | --all
webcmd plugin uninstall <name>
webcmd plugin create <name>
webcmd plugin search [query] -f json
webcmd plugin catalog list -f json
webcmd plugin catalog add <source>
webcmd plugin catalog remove <id>
```

Plugins are installable extensions pulled from git or local paths. Use `plugin search` for marketplace discovery and `plugin list` for already-installed plugins. Main-repo community CLIs are exposed through the root plugin catalog manifest, not bundled into npm's `clis/` set.

> **Note:** The repository's `plugins/` directory is not shipped in the npm package. Find the required plugin with `webcmd plugin search`, then install its `installSource` with `webcmd plugin install <installSource>`.

## External CLI Passthrough

```bash
webcmd external install gh
webcmd external register my-tool \
  --binary my-tool \
  --install "npm i -g my-tool" \
  --desc "My internal CLI"
webcmd external list
webcmd gh pr list --limit 5
webcmd docker ps
```

Built-in entries live in `src/external-clis.yaml`; user overrides live in `~/.webcmd/external-clis.yaml`.

## Shell Completion

```bash
webcmd completion bash
webcmd completion zsh
webcmd completion fish
```

The script prints to stdout; source or save it according to your shell.

## Where To Go Next

| Task | Load |
| --- | --- |
| Drive a live browser ad-hoc | `webcmd-browser` |
| Write a new adapter or command | `webcmd-adapter-author` |
| Fix a broken adapter after failure | `webcmd-autofix` |
| Route a search or research request | `smart-search` |

## Removed Commands

Do not invoke these removed commands:

- `webcmd explore <url>`: use `webcmd browser network` and `webcmd browser find`, or the `webcmd-adapter-author` workflow.
- `webcmd record <url>`: manual capture now lives in `webcmd browser network --detail`.
- Top-level `webcmd web read` / `webcmd desktop *` groups: use their adapters instead.

## Do Not

- Do not paste static command lists into plans; call `webcmd list -f json`.
- Do not assume every adapter needs a browser; check `strategy`.
- Do not silently fall back from a failing adapter to hand-rolled `fetch`; use `--trace retain-on-failure` first.
