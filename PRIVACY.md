# webcmd Privacy

The webcmd-managed CloakBrowser runtime communicates only with the local Webcmd daemon on `localhost:9777`.

The runtime can access browser pages and cookies because browser automation requires those permissions. Webcmd does not send browser data to AgentR. Commands run locally, and command output is printed to the local CLI process.

Trace artifacts, cache files, plugins, user adapters, and site memory are stored under `~/.webcmd`.
